# Bazel rules for Pylyglot

`rules_pylyglot` provides Bazel rules for combining a Python entry point and
its inputs into a single polyglot script.

## Installation

From the release you wish to use:
<https://github.com/scottpledger/rules_pylyglot/releases>
copy the Bzlmod snippet into your `MODULE.bazel` file.

To use a commit rather than a release, you can point at any SHA of the repo with an `archive_override` in MODULE.bazel.

For example to use commit `abc123`:

```starlark
archive_override(
    module_name = "rules_pylyglot",
    url = "https://github.com/scottpledger/rules_pylyglot/archive/abc123.tar.gz",
    strip_prefix = "rules_pylyglot-abc123",
    # The easiest way to set this is to comment out this line, then Bazel will print
    # a message with the correct value. Note that GitHub source archives don't have a strong
    # guarantee on the sha256 stability, see <https://github.blog/2023-02-21-update-on-the-future-stability-of-source-code-archives-and-hashes/>
    integrity = "...",
)
```
